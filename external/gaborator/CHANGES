Add "API Introduction" documentation section that was missing
from version 1.5, causing broken links.

Improve analysis and resynthesis performance when using PFFFT or vDSP
by automatically enabling the use of real rather than complex FFTs
where applicable.

1.5

Add navigation links to the HTML documentation.

Add a code example demonstrating synthesis of musical notes.

Add a function process() for iterating over coefficients sets with
greater flexibility than apply().  Also add a function fill() for
algorithmically creating new coefficients.

Make the C++ declarations in the API reference documents more closely
resemble actual C++ code.

Add a method gaborator::analyzer::band_ref() returning the band number
corresponding to the reference frequency.

1.4

Support building the library as C++17, while retaining compatibility
with C++11.

Further improve the performance of analyzing short signal blocks, and
of signal blocks not aligned to large powers of two.

Add a code example mesasuring the resynthesis signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR).

1.3

Eliminate some compiler warnings.

Declare gaborator::analyzer::band_ff() const, making the code match
the documentation.

Fix incorrect return type of gaborator::analyzer::band_ff() in the
documentation.

Improve performance of analyzing short signal blocks.

Remove special-case optimization of analyzing signal slices of all
zeros, as it caused incorrect results.

Support up to 384 bands per octave.

1.2

Add overview documentation.

Add real-time FAQ.

Actually include version.h in the release.

Fix off-by-one error in defintion of analyzer constructor ff_min
argument.

Fix incorrect return value of band_ff() for DC band.

Add streaming example code.

Add analyzer::analysis_support() and analyzer::synthesis_support().

Document analyzer::band_ff().

Improve signal to noise ratio at low numbers of bands per octave.

Note the need for -mfpu=neon on ARM in render.html.
